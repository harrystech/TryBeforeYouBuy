# Hackathon Project

## Goal
Build an app that lets users virtually shave a friends face utilizing the new Swift ARKit library.

## Some Process
* Let's try to use the same `branch -> commit -> push -> merge on github` 
	workflow that we use with platform code since everyone is familiar with that.

## Some resources
* ARKit Tutorial in Objective C (https://blog.markdaws.net/apple-arkit-by-example-ef1c8578fb59)
* Swift Documentation (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID309)
